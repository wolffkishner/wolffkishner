Greetings, my name is Yashraj. I am a technologist with a passion for interdisciplinary and cutting-edge projects. My fascination with gadgets began at an early age, but it was not until I participated in the Robotryst Festival at IIT Delhi in 2018 that I truly discovered my love for computing. Despite being a high school student, I have continued to learn and explore the ever-evolving world of technology.
