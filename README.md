Hello World!

some projects (experiments) just for fun:
- website design for my school hosting an interschool competition (was done in a few hours) - [Link](https://www.figma.com/design/IrBrArJ0Bl5NcN7yyQfxeH/eniac-secondary-design?node-id=0-1&t=Ozpa2bLvd307eqPa-1)
- another iteration of the above - [Link](https://www.figma.com/design/cj8X3lczOZa2cYBdS5IByA/eniac-secondary-design-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=p40PtE0sTLHAvfmx-1)
- trying to wireframe a product that would help people design APIs without code - [Link](https://www.figma.com/design/h6Spou7ygkMFhktu0mgbqy/apist?node-id=0-1&t=Q4ookbpDhX2OxZPm-1)
